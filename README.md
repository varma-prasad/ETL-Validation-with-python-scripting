## Overview

Design and Develop ETL pipeline from Oracle to Postgresql using informatica Powercenter.\
Perform ETL validation using Python scripting.

## ETL Validation using Python scripting


•	Connect to Source: oracle DB from Config file\
•	Read Source queries and load to DataFrame\
•	Connect to Target: pgAdmin from config file\
•	Read Target Queries and load to DataFrame\
•	Validate data with the help of Pandas module in python\
•	Check for count, duplicates, null, truncation and transformation in source and target\
•	Write test results into a separate file

## Design and Development

•	Import source and target details to the Designer\
•	Design Mapping from source to target with necessary transformation \
•	This is Cross DB ETL. Source is Oracle and Target is Pgadmin\
•	Lookup Transformation is used to fetch department name\
•	Filter transformation to limit the entry of data into target table\
•	Expression transformation used to replace null values for designation \
•	Sorter transformation is used to get distinct employee ids and to sort employees in Ascending order

## Data Validation

•	Check Run properties and session logs for the detailed report\
•	Check Count in Source and Target tables\
•	Check all the transformation logic are fulfilled such as (duplicates not loaded, Null values replaced)\
•	Check any data is truncated\
•	Using python scripts automate the testing of data validation and get results into a text file.
