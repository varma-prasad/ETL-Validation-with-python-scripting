## Overview

Design and Develop ETL pipeline from Oracle to Postgresql using informatica Powercenter.\
Perform ETL validation using Python scripting.

## ETL Validation using Python scripting


â€¢	Connect to Source: oracle DB from Config file\
â€¢	Read Source queries and load to DataFrame\
â€¢	Connect to Target: pgAdmin from config file\
â€¢	Read Target Queries and load to DataFrame\
â€¢	Validate data with the help of Pandas module in python\
â€¢	Check for count, duplicates, null, truncation and transformation in source and target\
â€¢	Write test results into a separate file

## Design and Development

â€¢	Import source and target details to the Designer\
â€¢	Design Mapping from source to target with necessary transformation \
â€¢	This is Cross DB ETL. Source is Oracle and Target is Pgadmin\
â€¢	Lookup Transformation is used to fetch department name\
â€¢	Filter transformation to limit the entry of data into target table\
â€¢	Expression transformation used to replace null values for designation \
â€¢	Sorter transformation is used to get distinct employee ids and to sort employees in Ascending order

## Data Validation

â€¢	Check Run properties and session logs for the detailed report\
â€¢	Check Count in Source and Target tables\
â€¢	Check all the transformation logic are fulfilled such as (duplicates not loaded, Null values replaced)\
â€¢	Check any data is truncated\
â€¢	Using python scripts automate the testing of data validation and get results into a text file.
